The raw experimental logs were minimally processed to form a dataset that focuses on the state and input trajectories around the impact event.

The processed data for each trajectory starts approximately 5ms before impact and last for 50ms.
The entire experimental logs can be obtained by contacting William Yang at yangwill@seas.upenn.edu. 

The correspondence between the processed data and the raw experimental logs is included below:
