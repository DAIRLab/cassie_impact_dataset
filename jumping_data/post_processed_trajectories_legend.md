The raw experimental logs were minimally processed to form a dataset that focuses on the state and input trajectories around the impact event.

The processed data for each trajectory starts approximately 5ms before impact and last for 50ms.
The entire experimental logs can be obtained by contacting William Yang at yangwill@seas.upenn.edu. 

The pelvis vertical offset was computed as the minimum height of all four possible contact points on the feet. 
This is to ensure that contact occurs at the same time in the simulators as it does in the hardware data. 

The correspondence between the processed data and the raw experimental logs is included below:
